<h4>Activity/activities:</h4> In tourism statistics, the term activities represent the actions and behaviors of people in preparation for and during a trip in their capacity as consumers (IRTS 2008, 1.2).<br>

<h4>Activity (principal):</h4> The principal activity of a producer unit is the activity whose value added exceeds that of any other activity carried out within the same unit (SNA 2008, 5.8).<br>

<h4>Activity (productive):</h4> The (productive) activity carried out by a statistical unit is the type of production in which it engages. It has to be understood as a process, i.e. the combination of actions that result in a certain set of products. The classification of productive activities is determined by their principal output.<br>

<h4>Administrative data:</h4> Administrative data is the set of units and data derived from an administrative source. This is a data holding information collected and maintained for the purpose of implementing one or more administrative regulations.<br>

<h4>Aggregated data:</h4> The result of transforming unit level data into quantitative measures for a set of characteristics of a population.<br>

<h4>Aggregation:</h4> A process that transforms microdata into aggregate-level information by using an aggregation function such as count, sum average, standard deviation, etc.<br>

<h4>Analytical unit:</h4> Entity created by statisticians, by splitting or combining observation units with the help of estimations and imputations.<br>

It consists of the goods and services account, the primary income account, the secondary income account, the capital account, and the financial account (BPM6, 2.12).<br>

Bias: An effect which deprives a statistical result of representativeness by systematically distorting it, as distinct from a random error which may distort on any one occasion but balances out on the average.<br>

<h4>Business and professional purpose (of a tourism trip): </h4>The business and professional purpose of a tourism trip includes the activities of the self-employed and employees, as long as they do not correspond to an implicit or explicit employer-employee relationship with a resident producer in the country or place visited, those of investors, businessmen, etc. (IRTS 2008, 3.17.2).<br>
